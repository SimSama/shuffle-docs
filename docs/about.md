# About
Shuffle started as a project in mid-2019 because of a few automation related problems that needed more attention in the [CERT/SIRT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_emergency_response_team) community. Available automation solutions in the security industry are trying to do everything at once; handle tickets, indicators, threat intel and much more in a single platform, while our goal is to build the best solution to fit all your existing tools following the [Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Do_One_Thing_and_Do_It_Well): "Do One Thing and Do It Well". 

## Open Source
Focus for Shuffle has moved to an entirely open ecosystem. This includes, but is not limited to; the Shuffle product, open workflows, open apps, open standards (OpenAPI, Swagger).

## Roadmap
This roadmap is meant more as a guide than as the exact order of operations.

* 0.1 - 0.5: Created basic features for automation, as well as use cases and frontend. This was before the project was open sourced.
* 0.6 - Usability: High focus on the workflow and app editor, as well as bugfixing after open sourcing.
